# Quasi_geostrophic-model
This is the project in which we perform data assimilation method (EnKS) with a 2-layer QG model, including the autocorrelated model error

To generate the data from the Fortran files, you just need to run the py file named EnKS_cycling.py which will also perform DA (EnKS) for multiple windows after finishing running the model. The parameter settings can be changed in the parameter.py file.
